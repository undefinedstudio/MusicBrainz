# MusicBrainz Web Service (v2) PHP class

This PHP library that allows you to easily access the MusicBrainz Web Service V2 API. Visit the [MusicBrainz development page](http://musicbrainz.org/doc/Development) for more information.

This project is a fork of https://github.com/chrisdawson/MusicBrainz and takes some inspiration from the [Python bindings](https://github.com/alastair/python-musicbrainz-ngs)

## Usage Example


```php
<?php
    use Guzzle\Http\Client;
    use MusicBrainz\Filters\ArtistFilter;
    use MusicBrainz\Filters\RecordingFilter;
    use MusicBrainz\HttpAdapters\GuzzleHttpAdapter;
    use MusicBrainz\MusicBrainz;

    require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

    $brainz = new MusicBrainz(new GuzzleHttpAdapter(new Client()), 'username', 'password');
    $brainz->setUserAgent('ApplicationName', '0.2', 'http://example.com');

    $args = array(
        "recording"  => "Buddy Holly",
        "artist"     => 'Weezer',
        "creditname" => 'Weezer',
        "status"     => 'Official'
    );
    try {
        $recordings = $brainz->search(new RecordingFilter($args));
        print_r($recordings);
    } catch (Exception $e) {
        print $e->getMessage();
    }
?>
